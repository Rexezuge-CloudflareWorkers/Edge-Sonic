/**
 * Fail when the SPA shell the API worker serves is missing or self-inconsistent.
 *
 * `DurableDavRouterWorker` answers browser navigations with `SPA_HTML`, embedded
 * from `apps/web/dist/index.html` by the Vite `spa-shell-embed` plugin. Both that
 * file and `apps/web/dist/` are gitignored build artifacts, so a fresh clone
 * gets the empty `postinstall` stub and every `GET /` returns a blank page —
 * with nothing in the source tree saying so.
 *
 * What this catches:
 * - the `postinstall` stub (or no build at all) still in place;
 * - `spa-shell.ts` referencing `/assets/...` bundles that were not emitted (a
 *   partially cleaned or half-copied `dist/`, which serves a shell whose JS
 *   404s and therefore renders no bucket browser at all);
 * - `spa-shell.ts` and `apps/web/dist/index.html` disagreeing, i.e. only one of
 *   the two halves of the build was refreshed.
 *
 * Known limit, deliberately stated rather than papered over: this cannot detect a
 * *stale but self-consistent* pair. A `dist/` and a `spa-shell.ts` built together
 * from last week's source agree with each other, and that is precisely the
 * failure this script was added after — the checked-in bundle was scaffolded
 * from another repository's build and predated every change to
 * `apps/web/src`, so the bucket browser it shipped was missing the fixes in
 * `davXml.ts` and `davClient.ts` entirely. That class is covered at the source
 * level by `test/web-davxml.test.ts` and `test/web-davclient.test.ts`. The
 * remaining duty is operational: run `pnpm run build` after touching `apps/web`,
 * before `wrangler deploy`.
