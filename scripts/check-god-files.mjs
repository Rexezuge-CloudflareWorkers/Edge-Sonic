/**
 * Fail CI when source files grow back into god-files.
 *
 * Rationale: a file past a few hundred lines stops being readable as a unit. The
 * failure modes are not hypothetical — this repo's own history has a 219-line
 * god-class and a 495-line React component, both of which had to be split by hand.
 * A cheap gate turns that from a discovery into a review prompt.
 *
 * Excludes: node_modules, dist, locales, generated, tests, migrations, lockfiles.
 * Soft limit 300 LOC (warn), hard limit 400 LOC (error).

Paths relative to ROOT, so the patterns below can match on directory too.

Every directory pattern is anchored with `(?:^|/)` rather than a bare leading `/`.
`relative()` yields `test/helpers/x.ts` for this repository's top-level test directory
and `scripts/lib/x.ts` for the scripts directory — **no leading separator** — so a
pattern written as `/\/(?:test|tests|__tests__)\//` never matches either one. It looks
right, it does match when handed an absolute path, and against these two directories
it is silently a no-op. The `scripts` pattern carries the anchor; the test-directory
pattern did not, so the exclusion was dead for the exact layout it was written for.
