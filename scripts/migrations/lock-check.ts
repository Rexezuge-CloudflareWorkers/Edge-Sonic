/**
 * The comparison behind `scripts/migrations/verify-migrations.ts`.
 *
 * Pure and exported so every rule is testable without touching the filesystem.
 * The filesystem side of the script is a `readdirSync` and a `createHash`, and
 * neither is where the risk lives.
 *
 * ### Why a checksum lock at all
 *
 * D1 records *which* migrations it has applied — the filename and a timestamp —
 * but not *what the file contained* when it applied them. So editing a migration
 * that has already run is not caught by anything: the deploy still succeeds, the
 * local database built from the baseline plus the edited file picks up the new
 * statements, and production keeps the schema it had. The two databases then
 * differ silently and permanently, and the next migration that assumes the newer
 * shape fails only in production.
 *
 * A committed digest per file turns that into a CI failure. The lock is a
 * forward-only guard: it says nothing about migrations applied before it
 * existed, and it deliberately makes re-baselining a squashed file a visible
 * `--write` rather than a silent acceptance.
 *
 * ### Why the lock has a baseline
 *
 * `migrations/0008_squash.sql` is a squash: it holds the combined schema of every
 * migration before it, and those files are deleted when it is created. A later
 * squash repeats that. So a squash legitimately (a) rewrites one file and
 * (b) removes files the lock still lists, and neither may be reported as drift.
 *
 * Adopting a baseline is not free, and the cost is stated in the squash file
 * itself: D1's `d1_migrations` on an existing database still lists the absorbed
 * filenames, and this repository no longer describes what they contained. D1
 * keeps that history, which is what makes it safe — but it means the baseline is
 * a deliberate act, not a formatting change, and the `duplicate-prefix` rule is
 * half of what forced this one.
 *
 * The baseline is the highest-numbered `NNNN_squash.sql` on disk. Everything at
 * or before it is exempt from the `edited` and `orphan` checks, because that is
 * exactly the set a squash rewrites or absorbs. Everything strictly after it is
 * incremental, has been applied on top of the baseline, and is immutable — that
 * is the set the checks exist to protect, and it is the only set where a
 * divergence can be silent.
