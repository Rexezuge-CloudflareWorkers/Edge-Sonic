/**
 * Verify `migrations/*.sql` against `migrations/migrations.lock.json`.
 *
 * D1 records which migrations it applied but not what they contained, so editing
 * an already-applied migration is invisible to every existing tool: the deploy
 * succeeds, fresh databases pick up the edited statements, and production keeps
 * the schema it had. This script turns that into a CI failure.
 *
 * Run with `pnpm run validate:migrations`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm run validate:migrations              verify only; changes nothing
 *   pnpm run migrations:lock                  record newly-added files
 *
 * `--write` adds an entry per unlocked file, refreshes the baseline, and drops
 * entries the baseline has absorbed. It never touches another existing entry, so
 * an incremental migration that has drifted still fails after a `--write`;
 * re-baselining one means deleting its entry by hand, which shows up in the diff.
 * The lock is then re-checked, so a `--write` that fixed everything exits 0 and
 * one that did not still exits 1.
 *
 * TypeScript rather than `.mjs` so the script is covered by the repo's lint and
 * typecheck rules; the rules themselves live in `lock-check.ts` so they are unit
 * tested. Run through `tsx` rather than `node` because of the extensionless
 * relative import, as every other script that imports a sibling module does.
