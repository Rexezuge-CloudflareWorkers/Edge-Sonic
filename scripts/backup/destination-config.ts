/**
 * Decides which destinations are configured and enforces fail-closed encryption.
 *
 * ### Why the encryption requirement is not optional here
 *
 * Two independent reasons, and they have different consequences so both are stated.
 *
 * **The at-rest protection assumes the dump is not in hand.** `users.password_ciphertext`
 * and `libraries.password_ciphertext` are AES-256-GCM, and `migrations/0008_squash.sql`
 * says so in its own comment: *"obfuscation against a D1 dump, not protection against a
 * full worker compromise."* An unencrypted backup inverts that assumption — dump plus the
 * Secrets Store key is a complete credential set for both the Subsonic users and every
 * WebDAV origin, and the WebDAV key is read on every scan and every stream.
 *
 * **The dump is a listening history.** `stars`, `ratings`, `play_counts`, `play_queue`,
 * `now_playing` and `auth_failures` record what each user listens to and when, and `nodes`
 * plus `songs` record the full library topology and every file path. None of that is
 * credential material, and all of it is nobody else's to read.
 *
 * S3_REGION is deliberately not part of the S3 gate. R2 and MinIO have no meaningful
 * region — Cloudflare documents an R2 bucket's region as `auto`, with empty and
 * `us-east-1` both aliasing to it — so requiring the secret would silently disable
 * backups for anyone using such a provider. The upload script defaults
 * `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to `auto` instead.
