/**
 * Compresses and encrypts the exported D1 dump.
 *
 * Fail-closed: without `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` the script refuses to run and
 * deletes nothing, so an unencrypted dump can never reach the artifact store
 * that the upload jobs read from.
 *
 * The passphrase is read from the environment rather than passed as an argument,
 * because command-line arguments are visible to any process on the runner via
 * `ps`. openssl's `env:` password source keeps it out of both the argv and the
 * shell history.
 *
 * Compression is xz at preset 6, chosen for ratio over speed: this runs once a
 * day against a dump that is mostly SQL text and JSON blobs, and LZMA typically
 * beats gzip by 20-30% there. `-T0` uses every available thread, which matters
 * because xz is markedly slower than gzip and the job is wall-clock bound.
 *
 * Emits the resulting file name as the `file` step output.
