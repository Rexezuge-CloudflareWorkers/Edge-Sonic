/**
 * Resolves which D1 database the backup workflow should export.
 *
 * Runs after `scripts/deploy/prepare-wrangler-config.ts` has materialized
 * `wrangler.jsonc`, so the database resolved here is exactly the one the deploy
 * targets — no separate `D1_DATABASE_ID` secret to keep in sync.
 *
 * Guards the failure mode that matters: **a database that was created moments ago holds
 * no user data**, and uploading its empty dump every night is a false sense of safety.
 * So this refuses when the provisioning step reports having created the database.
 *
 * That check reads `PROVISIONED_RESOURCES`, which the previous step emits — and it has
 * to. The reference project instead re-read the placeholder `database_id` out of
 * `wrangler.jsonc`, which is **unreachable**: the same job runs
 * `prepare-wrangler-config.ts` first, and `provisionWranglerResources` patches the
 * placeholder away before the reader runs, so no `database_id` can still equal it. The
 * guard could not fire for the one case it was written for, and a check that cannot fail
 * is indistinguishable from the absence of data. `resolveD1Target` still rejects a
 * placeholder as a second line of defence — it just is not the one doing the work.
 *
 * Emits the export target as the `target` step output.
