# Durable-DAV-Router — API Worker

Scope: `apps/api/**`. Parent index: `../../AGENTS.md`.

- `src/index.ts` — `fetch` only via `DurableDavRouterWorker` (stateless: no cron, no DOs, no `scheduled`).
- `src/workers/DurableDavRouterWorker.ts` — Hono routes (no file-routing), in this order: `securityHeaders` → `onError` → `/health` + SPA shell routes → `scopeMiddleware` → **`OPTIONS *` preflight** → `registerRateLimits` → `/user/*` auth → `/user/*` routes → volume-root content negotiation → WebDAV proxy. Order matters: the preflight must precede auth (a preflight carries no credentials), and the rate limiter must precede auth so it can key on the resolved identity. Runs `AppConfiguration.validate()` once per isolate on the first request. `src/types.d.ts` — global `Env`.
- `src/workers/routes/` — `BackendRoutes` (`GET|POST /user/backends`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /user/backends/:slug`, `GET /user/backends/:slug/me` identity proxy with `backend_username` cache write, `GET /user/backends/:slug/probe` diagnostic; no route-cache purge on edit/delete — the D1 revalidation below covers it) + `AggregatedVolumeRoutes` (`GET /user/volumes` fail-soft fan-out, `POST /user/volumes?backend=`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /user/volumes/:owner/:volume`, `/user/volumes/:owner/:volume/*` subpath proxy) + `RouterDavProxyRoutes` (all `SUPPORT_METHODS` on `/:owner/:volume[/...]`, plus `app.all` catch-alls returning `405`+`Allow` for a non-DAV method) + `UserRoutes` (`GET /user/me`). Both volume planes proxy the backend's JSON unreshaped, so a backend-owned field such as `hrefPrefixMode` rides through in both directions with no router-side model of it; `RouterDavProxyRoutes` returns `upstream.body` untouched for the same reason.
- `src/middleware/` — `securityHeaders` (baseline headers; CSP on the HTML shell only; `no-store` on `/user/*`; HSTS over HTTPS only), `rateLimit`+`rateLimitConfig` (per-isolate token buckets, keyed on the authenticated email or the trusted `CF-Connecting-IP`, **fail open**), `scopeMiddleware`, `MiddlewareHandlers.userAuthentication()`.

## Auth

- `/user/*` — Cloudflare Access (`DEMO_MODE` → `DEV_AUTH_EMAIL` → JWT → `ctx.access` fallback). Fan-out forwards `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`/`Authorization`/`Cookie` verbatim (pure passthrough, no stored secrets). The user row is upserted here so `router_backends.owner_email` has a parent to reference.
- WebDAV `/:owner/:volume/*` — owner-routed (no Access identity): per-backend `backend_username` cache → `listByBackendUsername(owner)`. Proxies bucket Basic verbatim; the backend enforces per-bucket auth. Unknown owner/no backend → `404`.

## Route cache self-heal

`RouterDavProxyRoutes` consults the KV `davRoute` lookaside (per-isolate L1 + KV, TTL from `ROUTE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`) for bare client URLs. A cached entry is **revalidated against D1 before forwarding** — a cache entry can name a deleted backend or a `base_url` that has since been edited, and the first symptom of that is a request already sent to the wrong origin. That revalidation is the *only* invalidation mechanism: a backend `PATCH`/`DELETE` deliberately does **not** purge the namespace, because the next bare request catches both cases without spending a forward. If the forward then returns `404`/`410`, the entry is distrusted and the route re-resolved. `502`/`504` are deliberately **not** staleness signals: they mean the origin is unreachable, which says nothing about whether the route is stale.

Replaying a request re-sends a body that has already been consumed, so a stale route on a `PUT` could write a truncated (or empty) file and a mutation that succeeded before its response was lost would apply twice. That is why replay is restricted to `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS`/`PROPFIND`.

### The write budget is the scarce resource

KV free plan: 1,000 writes + 1,000 deletes per day against 100,000 reads, plus 1 write/second/key. A request that evicts a stale entry and then re-resolves to **the same backend** must therefore write **nothing** — the entry already holds the right value, and a `delete`-then-`put` pair spends two of the scarce operations per request to move a key to the value it already had. That is not hypothetical: a client 404ing on every inner path (stale `If` headers, files removed on another device, a resource a partial sync has not recreated) used to do exactly that on every request and exhausted the whole daily budget in around 40 minutes, while answering every request correctly. Consequently:

- A `404`/`410` **never evicts on its own** — not even at the volume root. It is a hint; the re-resolution decides, by comparing. `proven` (D1 disagreed) is separated from merely-suspect (the origin 404'd) so a `502` from the candidate set can leave a suspect entry alone.
- A replacement is a single `put` (an upsert), never `delete`-then-`put`.
- A **lone** backend is never cached: `resolveBackend` short-circuits one candidate without probing, so the entry would hold a value the same request's D1 read already produced. The ambiguous→probe→single path is the only writer, because that is the only resolution that skipped a fan-out.
- A `Destination` purge on `MOVE`/`COPY` reads before it deletes (`invalidateCachedRouteIfPresent`): most cross-volume syncs name a destination never cached, and a delete spent on a missing key counts against the same allowance.
- The one eviction that cannot be a no-op is a stale route on a **non-replay-safe** method, which returns `404` without re-resolving, so nothing is left to compare against.

`test/router-dav-proxy.test.ts` → *KV write budget* asserts operation counts, not just statuses; a response-code assertion cannot see a quota being spent. `clearRouteCacheL1` between iterations models a fresh isolate, since a warm L1 would hide the cost entirely.

## Routes

- Backends: `GET|POST /user/backends` · `GET|PATCH|DELETE /user/backends/:slug` · `GET /user/backends/:slug/me` → `{slug, username}` · `GET /user/backends/:slug/probe`.
- Volumes: `GET /user/volumes(?backend=)` → `{volumes, backends: [{slug, ok, status}]}` · `POST /user/volumes?backend=` · `GET|PATCH|DELETE /user/volumes/:owner/:volume?backend=` · `ALL /user/volumes/:owner/:volume/*`.
- WebDAV proxy: the 12 `SUPPORT_METHODS` on `/:owner/:volume` + `/:owner/:volume/*`; anything else → `405` with `Allow`.
- **`OPTIONS` is a supported DAV method, so the CORS preflight shortcut must not shadow it.** `app.options('*')` is terminal, so answering *every* `OPTIONS` there also swallowed the RFC 4918 §9.1 capability probe and replied `204` with no `DAV:` header; clients that probe on connect aborted with "No Content". The shortcut is therefore gated on `Access-Control-Request-Method` (present on every Fetch-spec preflight, absent on a DAV probe) and everything else calls `next()` into the proxy, which forwards the backend's own `DAV:`/`Allow:` (`PASSTHROUGH_RESPONSE_HEADERS` already allowlists both). Assert the probe reaches the backend — a `204` on a DAV `OPTIONS` is the bug, not the fix.
- Users: `GET /user/me` → `{email}`.
- Public: `GET /health` · `/docs` · SPA shell `GET /, /new, /backends/new, /settings` · `OPTIONS *` preflight.

## Composition

- Single scope per request: `scopeMiddleware` installs one `Container`; handlers resolve via `BaseRoute.getScope(c).get(Tokens.X)`.
- `src/endpoints/IBaseRoute.ts` — a namespace of statics, **not** a template-method base: every route is a `registerX(app)` closure, so nothing extends it. It owns `getScope`, `readJson` (malformed/oversized body discrimination + 1 MiB cap), `jsonError` (canonical `Exception.Type` mapping), and `toErrorResponse` (delegates status/body to the shared `ErrorMapper`, then adds the request's locale and any `ConflictError.details`).
- Route handlers read bodies through `readJson` + an explicit type check. A raw `c.req.json() as {...}` cast lets a non-string field reach `.trim()` and surface as a 500 where the answer is a 400.
- Never import `@edge-sonic/backend-data` values in routes (type-only allowed); never import `dav-store`/`background` (deleted) — use `@edge-sonic/backend-services/router` proxy helpers + `fetch`.
